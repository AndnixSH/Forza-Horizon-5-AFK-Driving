# Forza Horizon 5 AFK Driving

I will share my methods how to afk driving in Forza Horizon 5. 100% legit, no glitch

# Setup

First, you need to change the difficulty to the following

- Braking: Assisted
- Steering: Auto-Steering
- Traction control: ON
- Stability control: ON
- Shifting: Manual (Recommended if you do goliath afk, so the car doesn't randomly crash. Simply shift all the way to max and that's all)
- Damage and tire wear: Cosmetic (We don't want to wear the tire)

## PC

#### Keyboard
- Find something that can hold W key on keyboard
- Use [Autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) and use my [AHK script](https://github.com/AndnixSH/Forza-Horizon-5-AFK-Driving/releases). Simply double click to run in background. Press F8 to hold down W key. If you want to stop the script, exit from system tray icon

#### Controller
- If you have an Xbox controller, use rubberband or hair tie on the right trigger (RT) to hold it down. (See image below)
- If you have Playstation controller, you will need to setup ViGEm. It might be hard to use rubberband on PS3 controller, but you can put clips to hold the R2 down (See image below)

#### Multitasking
Use [DisplayFusion](https://www.displayfusion.com/). Prevent Window Deactivation is a PAID feature

In the game, turn off full screen and click on the small icon -> Run Function on Window -> Window Management -> Prevent Window Deactivation (keeps game windows focused). You should hear a "whoosh" sound to let you know that the function ran. After you hear the sound effect, you should be able to Alt+Tab out of the game and the game will not pause.

If you know other free ways, let me know

What about virtual machine? Vmware and Virtualbox does not support Directx 12. I believe Hyper-V support DirectX 12 with GPU passthrough. I don't recommended it if you use Vmware, Virtualbox or Android emulators since Hyper-V disable Virtualization

## Xbox cloud gaming (PC)
I recommended to use the browser version https://www.xbox.com/en-US/play

You can do the same on Android and iOS on browser or an app, but I don't recommended to use phones for that

#### Keyboard
Xbox cloud gaming does not support keyboard. You must use Xbox 360 Controller Emulator (Windows) and map the keys you like to https://www.x360ce.com/

- Find something that can hold a key on keyboard
- Use [Autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) and use my [AHK script](https://github.com/AndnixSH/Forza-Horizon-5-AFK-Driving/releases). Edit the script with any text editor of your choice and change a key. Simply double click to run in background. Press F8 to hold down a key. If you want to stop the script, exit from system tray icon

#### Controller
- Xbox controller, Playstation controller or other supported controller, use rubberband or hair tie on the right trigger to hold it down. 
- If you have a Playstation controller, you will need to setup ViGEm (Windows) or other drivers on other systems. It might be hard to use rubberband on PS3 controller, but you can put clips to hold the R2 down

#### Multitasking
Use Always active Window extension for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/always-active-window-alwa/ehllkhjndgnlokhomdlhgbineffifcbj?hl=en), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/always-visible/), [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/extensions/details/always-active-window-always-visible/) and [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/mpappcpgjachepaibhgpbnhhmneojmkc)

## Xbox consoles
Only one method, use rubberband or hair tie on the right trigger (RT) to hold it down. 


## The trick
